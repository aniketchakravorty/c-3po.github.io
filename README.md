### Research Objectives
#### The objective of our lab, Climate Complexity Collective-Predictive Observations, is to understand and quantify the complexity of climate and its changes in a warming world with the hope that it will help us in predicting our surrounding changes better. Our lab focuses on rainfall processes over the complex topographic region of North East India. Our lab uses information theory to understand the complexity and the dependency structure of the factors effecting the complexity of the rainfall generating process. Machine and Statistical learning is also being explored in our lab to emulate the rainfall generating process in this region using data from various sources.
